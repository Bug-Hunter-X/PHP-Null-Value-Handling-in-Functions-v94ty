# PHP Null Value Handling in Functions

This repository demonstrates a common issue in PHP related to handling null values in function arguments.  Due to PHP's loose typing system, unexpected null return values can result if null is not explicitly checked for in function parameters.

The `bug.php` file contains code that shows the issue in action.  The `bugSolution.php` demonstrates a correct way to handle this situation.

This code highlights the importance of explicit null checks when dealing with function arguments to prevent unexpected behavior and ensure proper functionality.
